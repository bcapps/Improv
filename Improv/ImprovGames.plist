			<string>10 Fingers</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Great game for getting to know each other in a new group. All players in a circle, holding all 10 fingers up in the air. One person at a time, start asking personal questions that take yes-no answers, whoever cannot answer yes to a question, drops a finger. Last person with a finger left wins. Good questions are things like &amp;quot;I have a cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I have never stolen anything&amp;quot; and so on.</string>

			<string>3 Series</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Everyone in a circle. Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names kinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever). First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else. Keep pointing. That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone points at one person. Then repeat the pattern. Make eye contact when passing your item to the next person. Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the series is collectively memorized. Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing pattern is different. Repeat till everyone is comfortable. Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories at the same time. Add a third, fourth category if you wish. No pointing arms any more! The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when it`s your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you. If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.</string>

			<string>Fun warm-up. One player offers something, e.g. I am a slice of cheese. 2nd player jumps in and adds something to the offer, e.g. I am a slice of bread. 3rd player jumps in and again adds to the setup, e.g. I am a pickle. First player leaves, taking one of the others with him. Restart from the remaining player, who restarts by saying what/who she is.</string>

			<string>Accepting Circle</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Get everyone in a big circle. One player starts by making a little gesture perhaps with a little sound. His or her neighbor then tries and does exactly the same. And so on. Although we expect the gesture/sound not to change, it will. Notes Watch for movements that suddenly change left/right arm or leg. This is not really supposed to happen, but it will. Once happened, it should be accepted by the next player. Also watch/listen for little moans or sighs that players might make before or after their turn - these should also be taken over by the next player.</string>

			<string>Great warm-up that also helps a new group to learn each other&apos;s names. Everyone in a circle. First person says his name, making a gesture (an action) for every syllable. Mary has 2 syllables, so she does something like &amp;quot;Ma-&amp;quot; (wave right hand) &amp;quot;-ry&amp;quot; (claps in hands). Everyone repeats this. Then the second person calls his name, again with a gesture per syllable. Group repeats, and then repeats all previous names and syllables.</string>

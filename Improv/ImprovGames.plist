			<string>10 Fingers</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Great game for getting to know each other in a new group. All players in a circle, holding all 10 fingers up in the air. One person at a time, start asking personal questions that take yes-no answers, whoever cannot answer yes to a question, drops a finger. Last person with a finger left wins. Good questions are things like &amp;quot;I have a cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I have never stolen anything&amp;quot; and so on.</string>

			<string>3 Series</string>
			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Everyone in a circle. Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names kinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever). First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else. Keep pointing. That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone points at one person. Then repeat the pattern. Make eye contact when passing your item to the next person. Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the series is collectively memorized. Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing pattern is different. Repeat till everyone is comfortable. Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories at the same time. Add a third, fourth category if you wish. No pointing arms any more! The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when it`s your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you. If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.</string>

			<string>Fun warm-up.
